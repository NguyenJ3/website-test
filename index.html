<p>
<em> History </em>

  <p>
    Anyone can become a Kpop star. Many dreams of becoming one for those who reach that dream of becoming an Idol in the Hallyu scene. They would have to audition for a company in order to become a candidate for an Idol. Once a company has scouted the talent, the talent becomes what is known as a "trainee". The trainee then trains in dancing, language, vocal lessons and acting.
    The trainee goes through rigorous training in hopes of debuting under a group in which their company creates. The amount of training one can go through varies from months to years; Suho of EXO trained for 7 years, Baekhyun (EXO) trained for 4 months. As stated anyone can become an Idol, during the years or months of training. The trainee must compete with other trainees
    in order to make debut for a group. Many shows such as Produce 101 depict the fierce competition trainees go through to reach their dreams of stardom. If a trainee fails to reach debut they either continue to train or cancel their contract. If the trainee makes debut then, they have assured a chance to become the new wave of Kpop Idols.

  <strong> The darkside of Kpop</strong>
  <p>
    Due to the culture of Kpop, many of the idols have to keep a clean image. Because of this fans often put their idol on a pedestal, that is often why Kpop artist are called idols. Because these idols have a clean image and are put on pedestals, many of them must act a certain way in order to fit in with what their fans and companies want. But since idols are humans as well
    many have failed to keep that image and, destroyed many expectations fans had of them. One of the most recent controversies, ex-member of Ikon B.I has been accused by the press of purchasing illegal substances. This lead to the idol canceling his contract with YG entertainment(former agency)and his departure from the group IKON. There are many cases of idols acting out of image which ends up in a controversy. If the scandal that an idol has participated in is big, then they either leave the industry for good or announce a reflection period leaving on a hiatus.
  <p>
  <em> The contracts</em>
  <p>
    During the time the idol was a trainee the company invests in that future idol. These investments cover the trainee's cost of living, food, dorms, and classes. The average cost of making an idol a year is 85,000 USD, as the trainee's training time can differ many idols accumulate debt during that period. When they debut, the idol must pay off the debt they have gained through their training days, this often leads to the controversial Kpop slavery contracts. The Kpop slavery contracts are told to be the nonstop working of the idols, fans have speculated that a company's contract allows the idols little to no rest or free time until they have paid their debt off. The slave contract has caught more attention as more idols seem ill or restless
